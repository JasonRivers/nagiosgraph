1.4.2 TBD

* new configuration options (see nagiosgraph.conf for details):
     language (optional)
     showprocessingtime (optional)
     default_geometry (optional)
     cgilogfile (optional)
* added i18n.  this is a very basic, no-dependencies implementation.  the
   intent is to be completely self contained, add minimal overhead, and not
   break existing installations.  error messages are not translated.  the
   language is detected from the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE variable.  this can
   be overridden by explicit cgi argument.  language can be forced by
   specifying it in the nagiosgraph configuration file.
* added labels file.  labels can be specified individually via cgi arguments
   or via configuration files for specific combinations of host/service/data.
   labels can be overridden for individual languages, independenly of i18n.
   labels in nagiosgraph.conf are now ignored.  move them to the labels file.
* recognize relative paths for configuration filenames.  prepend the config
   dir when relative paths are specified.
* include a line with the hostname in the input to the map rules.  this
   enables the use of map rules that are host-specific.  this is a significant
   change from the previous 3-line behavior, but it will not break existing
   map rules unless they depend on the line count.  having the host information
   also makes it easier to diagnose parsing issues when processing data.
* remove trailing newline from perfdata string.
* enable display of data sets from multiple rrd files into a single graph.
* prevent name clashes between data set names by using qualified identifiers
   rather than just data names in graph definitions.
* optionally report processing time.  processing time does *not* include the
   time required by showgraph.cgi to generate all of the graphs.
* optionally specify a default width and height.
* hostdb.conf and servdb.conf are now optional.  if these files are not 
   specified, or if they contain no entries, then data for every service
   (showhost.cgi) and data for every host (showservice.cgi) will be
   displayed.  use the hostdb and servdb files to filter graphs and
   control the order in which graphs are shown.
* started refactoring of code to eliminate redundant trips to disk for 
   host/service/dataset listings and to enable pattern matching in
   the *db.conf files.
* contents of README.map are now in INSTALL
* display rrdgraph and other error messages if GD is installed.  log the
   error messages whether or not GD is installed.
* do not create data directories unless we really have to do so (fixes a
   longstanding permissions bug)
* use separate cgi log file to avoid permissions conflicts.  attempt to
   fallback gracefully when permissions are not configured properly.
* consolidated log file initialization.
* refactored error handling and reporting, should be more consistent now.
* refer to 'new style' and 'old style' processing as 'batch' and 'immediate'

1.4.1 2010-02-18

* gave up on hiding data set selector after much (futile) javascript wrangling
* added date/time picker for specifying arbitrary end date
* showgraph.cgi accepts period (which is overridden by any rrdopts)
* use button instead of toggle to show/hide graph controls (keeps ie8 happy)
* fixed prev/next behavior
* added instructions and javascript for doing graphs on mouseovers in nagios
* rrdopts from config are now respected by showgraph.cgi
* added sans-serif to css to keep (many) unix clients happy
* fixed alignment of graph labels
* eliminate vestigial 'graph' CGI option.
* labels for services and data sets are now implemented throughout all cgi
   scripts.  the first place to define them is nagiosgraph.conf.  labels
   can be further specialized by defining them in hostdb.conf and
   groupdb.conf files.
* added mechanism to define default subset of datasets per service.
* added format strings for dates and times
* fixed showservice.cgi so that it now requires only host names in the 
   servdb.conf file.
* made parsing and handling of *db.conf files more consistent
* the *db.conf files now include detailed comments about file format
* comment character in *db.conf file must be at beginning of line in order
   to be treated as comment.
* added showgroup.cgi to display arbitrary groups of host/service/dataset.
   group definitions go in groupdb.conf.
* major overhaul of the javascript.  state is managed better now, and a lot
   of redundant code was removed.  there are more functions now, but the
   functions are more precise with fewer side effects.
* retain expanded/collapsed state of controls between reloads
* retain selection state of host, service, data set, and time periods
* added light/dark and green-tuple custom color palettes to config file
* fixed debugging controls in testcolor.cgi, showgraph.cgi, and show.cgi
* right-align text in the color tester
* updated the documentation: README, INSTALL, TODO
* new configuration options (see nagiosgraph.conf for details):
    showtitle
    showdesc
    showgraphtitle
    graphonly
    hidelegend
    hidengtitle
    lineformat
    plotasLINE1, plotasLINE2, plotasLINE3, plotasAREA, plotasTICK
    negate
    nagioscgiurl
    nagiosgraphcgiurl
    refresh
    geometries
    expand_timeall, expand_timehost, expand_timeservice, expand_timegroup
    timeformat_now
    timeformat_day, timeformat_week, timeformat_month
    timeformat_quarter, timeformat_year
    timegroup
    datasetdb
    groupdb
* modified configuration options:
    'time' is now 'timeall'
    timeall, timehost, timeservice take comma-delimited lists
    'color' is now 'colors'
* deleted configuration options:
    nolabels
    graphlabels
    large
    small
* host and service are no longer required args.  just do the right thing.
* use the same controls layout for all cgi apps
* adjusted time period title layout
* added labels to time periods
* control on each time period to collapse/expand that period
* default to collapsed state for controls
* added time period options to the controls
* put http refresh interval into config file
* eliminate tt and strong tags, replace with css
* when missing translation, instruct to put translation in .conf not .pm
* optionally show html title by each graph
* optionally show data set names by each graph
* optionally show title in each rrdgraph
* optionally hide <h1>Nagiosgraph</h1> for more graph and less text
* consolidation of show*.cgi code

* Fix for 'maximums'/'minimums' graphing integers only reported by Simon Lang
  and fix provided by Dmitry.

1.3.0 2009-03-26

* Modify the JavaScript (mostly) and ngshared.pm to use an array of arrays
  with the first entry in the subarray as the hostname, rather than using
  JavaScript object as a hash of arrays. This eliminates the restrictions
  on host names ('-', etc. are OK now), but could cause performance issues
  with large server name lists. Thanks to Susan Wilson at Emerson for patches,
  testing and debugging.
* Add version numbers in the "Create by" at the bottom of each page.

1.2.1 2009-02-02

* Add a db names coding bug reported and fix provided by Eric Gerbier.

* Add support for tracking and graphing minimum and maximum values. This should
  be good for things like ping round trip time. Per request from Jay Anderson.
* Add support for RRD scaling (altautoscale, altautoscalemin, altautoscalemax,
  notgridfit, logarithmic). Per request from Oskar Hajek.
* Add support for selecting a particular data item for graphing via a menu
  item in show.cgi. Per request from Mathias Waack.
* Fix bug about not showing multiple diagram titles correctly as reported by
  Rainer Brunold.
* Fix bug in translation that required manual entry of UNIX file system paths
  to avoid a runtime warning as reported by James Gardner.

1.1.3 2008-12-22

* Update ngshared to have the RRD directory write test not occur except after
  directory creation, fixing a problem of the CGIs failed when all apache
  needs to do is read the contents of the directory (reported by Ian Macdonald).

1.1.2 2008-11-06

* Update ngshared.pm to fix JavaScript navigation menu problem reported (and
  fix provided) by Alex Semenov.

* Fix only process one line bug when used via service_perfdata_file.
* Move all subroutines into ngshared.pm and add more tests.
* Separate graph creation from show.cgi into showgraph.cgi (now show.cgi,
  showhost.cgi and showservice.cgi just build HTML and call showgraph.cgi).

  the only configuration change in the executable scripts is done via the
  'use lib ....' line at the beginning of each script.
