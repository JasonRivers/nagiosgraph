These are the installation and configuration instructions for nagiosgraph.

Nagios monitors one or more services on each host.  nagiosgraph extracts
information from the Nagios output, processes it, then inserts it into one
or more round-robin database (RRD) files.  nagiosgraph cgi scripts display
data from the RRD files as web pages.

Installation is a three-step process.  First install the nagiosgraph files,
then configure Nagios for data collection, and finally customize the graphs
and links as needed.  Installation can be done manually by copying files and
modifying configuration files, or automatically using the install.pl script.

Quick Start
-----------

To install nagiosgraph:

    install.pl

To see a list of options:

    install.pl --help


Installation Preliminaries
--------------------------

Before installing, ensure that the prerequisite software has been installed
then decide upon a layout and location.


Prerequisites
-------------

Nagiosgraph will not function without a working Nagios installation, so
first ensure that Nagios works.  Version 3.2 or later is recommended, but
older versions will also work.

Nagiosgraph requires rrdtool.  Version 1.4 or later is recommended, but
older versions will also work.

Nagiosgraph requires the CGI and RRDs perl modules.  The RRDs perl module
is part of rrdtool.  The GD perl module is optional, but recommended.

  Debian/Ubuntu:
    rrdtool, perl, libcgi-pm-perl, librrds-perl, libgd-gd2-perl
  Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:
    rrdtool, perl, perl-rrdtool, perl-GD
  SUSE:
    rrdtool, perl, perl-GD
  Solaris:
    ?
  FreeBSD:
    rrdtool, perl5, gd

The install.pl script includes an option to check for pre-requisites:

    install.pl --check-prereq  


Layout and Location
-------------------

There are two standard layouts: separate or overlay.  The separated layout
has nagiosgraph and nagios in separate directories.  The overlay places
nagiosgraph components with nagios components.

Nagios and nagiosgraph can be installed in just about any location, for
example /opt or /usr/local.

Redhat (Fedora, CentOS), SUSE, and Debian (Ubuntu) systems have their own
layouts.  If you installed Nagios from a package, you can overlay nagiosgraph
or you can install nagiosgraph to its own standalone location.  The standalone
layout is usually easier to manage across updates when installing from source.

Decide upon a location and layout before you start the installation.
Examples are in the Sample Installation Layouts section.


Installation Methods
--------------------

There are a few ways to install nagiosgraph: manual, script, and package.
On most systems the installation requires root permissions, so either do
the installation as root or preface commands with sudo.

Manual Installation.  Copy and edit files directly.  Follow the instructions
in the following sections of this document:

  'Installing nagiosgraph Files'       - nagiosgraph installation
  'Configuring Data Processing'        - nagios configuration
  'Configuring Graphing and Display'   - apache and nagios configuration

Install Script.  Run the install.pl script.  It will prompt you for the
parameters it needs, then it will copy and configure nagiosgraph files.
It will also prompt you to modify apache and nagios configuration files.

  install.pl --layout overlay --prefix /usr/local/nagios
  install.pl --layout standalone --prefix /opt/nagiosgraph
  install.pl --layout custom --prefix /usr/local/nagiosgraph
  install.pl --layout debian
  install.pl --layout redhat
  install.pl --layout suse

Installation Using Packages.  The nagiosgraph packages assume that Nagios
and apache were installed from packages.  Do not use a nagiosgraph package
if you installed Nagios or apache from source!

  dpkg -i nagiosgraph-x.y.z.deb        - debian, ubuntu
  rpm -i nagiosgraph-x.y.z.rpm         - redhat, fedora, centos, suse


Installing nagiosgraph Files
----------------------------

These instructions assume an overlay layout, with nagios at /usr/local/nagios.

 - Extract nagiosgraph into a temporary location:
     cd /tmp
     tar xzvf nagiosgraph-x.y.z.tgz

 - Copy the contents of etc into your preferred configuration location:
     mkdir /etc/nagiosgraph
     cp etc/* /etc/nagiosgraph

 - Edit the perl scripts in the cgi and lib directories, modifying the
   "use lib" line to point to the directory from the previous step.
     vi cgi/*.cgi lib/insert.pl

 - Copy insert.pl to a location from which it can be executed:
     cp lib/insert.pl /usr/local/nagios/libexec

 - Copy CGI scripts to a script directory served by the web server:
     cp cgi/*.cgi /usr/local/nagios/sbin

 - Copy CSS and JavaScript files to a directory served by the web server:
     cp share/nagiosgraph.css /usr/local/nagios/share
     cp share/nagiosgraph.js /usr/local/nagios/share

 - Edit /etc/nagiosgraph/nagiosgraph.conf.  Set at least the following:
     perflog           = /var/nagios/perfdata.log
     rrddir            = /var/nagios/rrd
     mapfile           = /etc/nagiosgraph/map
     nagiosgraphcgiurl = /nagios/cgi-bin
     javascript        = /nagios/nagiosgraph.js
     stylesheet        = /nagios/nagiosgraph.css

 - Set permissions of "rrddir" (as defined in nagiosgraph.conf) so that
   the *nagios* user can write to it and the *www* user can read it:
     mkdir /var/nagios/rrd
     chown nagios /var/nagios/rrd
     chmod 755 /var/nagios/rrd

To keep nagiosgraph log output separate from nagios and web server output,
do the following:

 - Edit nagiosgraph.conf.  Set the following:
     logfile           = /var/log/nagiosgraph.log
     cgilogfile        = /var/log/nagiosgraph-cgi.log

 - Set permissions of "logfile" so that the *nagios* user can write to it:
     touch /var/log/nagiosgraph.log
     chown nagios /var/log/nagiosgraph.log
     chmod 664 /var/log/nagiosgraph.log

 - Set permissions of "cgilogfile" so that the *www* user can write to it:
     touch /var/log/nagiosgraph-cgi.log
     chown www /var/log/nagiosgraph-cgi.log
     chmod 664 /var/log/nagiosgraph-cgi.log


Upgrade Notes
-------------

 - Follow the steps above, but keep your customizations.  Your changes should
   be limited to the map file (map), configuration files (nagiosgraph.conf
   and other .conf files), and the stylesheet (nagiosgraph.css).

 - Use diff, or a similar tool, to update your nagiosgraph.conf with any new
   fields from etc/nagiosgraph.conf

 - Use diff, or a similar tool, to update your nagiosgraph.css with changes
   from share/nagiosgraph.css.

 - You may want to look at etc/map or the files in the examples directory
   to see if there are any map rules or CSS useful to your configuration.

 - If you change from immediate processing to batch processing, be sure to
   comment out service_perfdata_command in the nagios configuration.

 - Be sure to install the nagiosgraph.js and nagiosgraph.css files, especially
   if you are upgrading from nagiosgraph older than 1.2.

 - If you are upgrading from nagiosgraph 1.4.1 or earlier, move your service
   and database/datasource labels from nagiosgraph.conf to labels.conf.

 - If you are upgrading from nagiosgraph 1.4.3 or earlier and you were using
   nagios3 for the authzmethod, you must replace authz_nagios_cfg and
   authz_cgi_cfg with authzfile.  All of the Nagios authorization parameters
   should be in the Nagios CGI configuration file (typically cgi.cfg).

 - If you are upgrading from nagiosgraph 1.4.3 or earlier, you might want to
   add the generic map rule to the end of your map file.  This rule will
   catch performance data from any additional plugins you add.  Using the
   generic rule results in RRD files with the following structure, one file
   per named performance data element, with one or more data sources:

          host0/service___label (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])

 - If you are upgrading from nagiosgraph 1.4.3 or earlier, you should make any
   ignore map rules explicit.  For example, in the map file change this:

          /output:CHECK_NRPE: Socket timeout/
          and return;

   to this:

          /output:CHECK_NRPE: Socket timeout/
          and return ('ignore');


Configuring Data Processing
---------------------------

Before nagiosgraph can graph anything it must first collect data.  There are
two ways to process data - batch and immediate.  Batch processing is usually
appropriate for most Nagios deployments.  Immediate processing typically
requires more CPU and I/O.

In batch processing, performance data are appended to a file, then nagios
invokes insert.pl at a regular interval to update the RRD files.

In immediate processing, nagios invokes insert.pl immediately after each
service check, thus updating the corresponding RRD files.


Batch Processing
----------------

 - In nagios.cfg set:

     process_performance_data=1
     service_perfdata_file=/var/nagios/perfdata.log
     service_perfdata_file_template=$LASTSERVICECHECK$||$HOSTNAME$||$SERVICEDESC$||$SERVICEOUTPUT$||$SERVICEPERFDATA$
     service_perfdata_file_mode=a
     service_perfdata_file_processing_interval=30
     service_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-service-perfdata

   Make sure that service_perfdata_command is either commented out
   or not defined.

   Make sure that location of service_perfdata_file matches that of perflog
   defined in nagiosgraph.conf.

 - In commands.cfg (or checkcommands.cfg or misccommands.cfg for older
   versions of Nagios, depending on which is defined in nagios.cfg) define
   the process-service-perfdata command:

     define command {
       command_name  process-service-perfdata
       command_line  /usr/local/nagios/libexec/insert.pl
     }

   Make sure there is only one definition for process-service-perfdata.

 - Restart nagios

     /etc/init.d/nagios restart


Immediate Processing
--------------------

 - In nagios.cfg:

     process_performance_data=1
     service_perfdata_command=process-service-perfdata

   Make sure that service_perfdata_file_processing_command is either
   commented out or not defined.

 - In checkcommands.cfg or misccommands.cfg, depending on which one is
   defined in nagios.cfg:

     define command{
       command_name  process-service-perfdata
       command_line  /usr/local/nagios/libexec/insert.pl "$LASTSERVICECHECK$||$HOSTNAME$||$SERVICEDESC$||$SERVICEOUTPUT$||$SERVICEPERFDATA$"
     }

 - Restart nagios

     /etc/init.d/nagios restart



Configuring Graphing and Display
--------------------------------

First configure the web server to run the nagiosgraph CGI scripts.  For
example, with Apache do something like this in the Apache configuration:

  ScriptAlias /nagios/cgi-bin /usr/local/nagios/sbin
  <Directory "/usr/local/nagios/sbin">
     Options ExecCGI
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
  </Directory>

Verify that nagiosgraph is working by running showconfig.cgi

  http://server/nagios/cgi-bin/showconfig.cgi

Try graphing some data by running show.cgi

  http://server/nagios/cgi-bin/show.cgi

This should display a web page with a list of your hosts and services.
Note that it might take a few minutes for data to collect, so at first the
list of hosts and services might be sparse and the graphs might be empty.

There are a few ways to embed graphs into nagios.  In the service and
host listings, Nagios will display graph icons that, when clicked, will
open a new web page with graphs.  These icons are typically per-host
(linked to the showhost.cgi script) or per-host-service (linked to the
show.cgi script).  Nagios will display graph data when the mouse is moved
over the graph icon for each host/service.  Finally, graphs can be displayed
directly in the Nagios frames.  The following sections explain how to do each
of these.



Displaying Per-Service and Per-Host Graph Icons and Links in Nagios
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Links to graphs can be embedded in Nagios status pages using the notes or
actions fields.  The specifics depend on the Nagios version as well as how
you have configured your host and service definitions.  Nagios 2 uses the
serviceextinfo and hostextinfo construct.  In Nagios 3 the nagiosgraph
additions go directly in the host and service definitions.

 - For Nagios 2.6 and earlier,

     If you have these lines in nagios.cfg, un-comment the 2 cfg_file= lines:

     # Extended host/service info definitions are now stored along with
     # other object definitions:
     # cfg_file=/etc/nagios/hostextinfo.cfg
     # cfg_file=/etc/nagios/serviceextinfo.cfg

     Otherwise, define in cgi.cfg the following:

     xedtemplate_config_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/serviceextinfo.cfg

   Edit/Create hostextinfo.cfg

     define hostextinfo {
       host_name  your-host
       action_url /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/showhost.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$
     }

     This must be the host you will use in serviceextinfo.cfg

   Edit/Create serviceextinfo.cfg

     define serviceextinfo {
       service_description  DNS
       hostgroup       servers
       notes_url       /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/show.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$
       icon_image      graph.gif
       icon_image_alt  View graphs
     }

 - For Nagios 2.9 and Nagios 3, use the action_url for any existing host
   or service definition.  For example,

     define service {
       name NTP
       use local-service
       action_url /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/show.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$
     }

   To apply graph links to multiple services, define a template such as this:

     define service {
       name graphed-service
       action_url /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/show.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$
     }

   Then use it in services like this:

     define service {
       name NTP
       use local-service,graphed-service
     }

 - To display a graph icon instead of the nagios action icon, replace
   nagios/images/action.gif with graph.gif from the nagiosgraph distribution.

 - In its default configuration, Nagios will create a new window for each
   action or notes link.  To display graphs in the Nagios frame instead of
   a new window, set action_url_target=main in the Nagios cgi.cfg file.



Displaying Graphs in Nagios Mouseovers
--------------------------------------

To display graphs as mouseovers for each host and/or service, do the following:

  - Edit the file share/nagiosgraph.ssi to contain the correct URL to
    nagiosgraph.js (e.g. /nagios/nagiosgraph.js)

  - If you have not customized the Nagios SSI, copy share/nagiosgraph.ssi to
    the nagios ssi directory, and rename it so that Nagios will insert it into
    each page.  For example:

      cp share/nagiosgraph.ssi /usr/local/nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi

    If you have customized Nagios SSI, add the contents of
    share/nagiosgraph.ssi to your customized SSI header file(s).

  - Configure services to display graphs on mouseovers by adding some 
    JavaScript to action_url or notes_url.  For example:

     define service {
       name NTP
       use local-service
       action_url /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/show.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$' onMouseOver='showGraphPopup(this)' onMouseOut='hideGraphPopup()' rel='/nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/showgraph.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$
     }

    This example displays a week of data in a popup with no legend:

     define service {
       name NTP
       use local-service
       action_url /nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/show.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$' onMouseOver='showGraphPopup(this)' onMouseOut='hideGraphPopup()' rel='/nagiosgraph/cgi-bin/showgraph.cgi?host=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICEDESC$&period=week&rrdopts=-w+450+-j
     }

You must restart Nagios for changes to service/host defintions to take effect.

If a service includes multiple data sources, use the datasetdb file (specified
in nagiosgraph.conf) to indicate which data sources should be displayed by
default for each service, or specify the data source(s) explicity in each
action_url.



Displaying Graphs in Nagios Frames
----------------------------------

To embed nagiosgraph graphs directly into nagios, do the following:

  - Modify side.php (e.g. /usr/local/nagios/share/side.php) by inserting
    bullets under the 'Trends' heading:

<li><a href="<?php echo $cfg["cgi_base_url"];?>/trends.cgi" target="<?php echo $link_target;?>">Trends</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?php echo $cfg["cgi_base_url"];?>/show.cgi" target="<?php echo $link_target;?>">Graphs</a></li>
<li><a href="<?php echo $cfg["cgi_base_url"];?>/showhost.cgi" target="<?php echo $link_target;?>">Graphs by Host</a></li>
<li><a href="<?php echo $cfg["cgi_base_url"];?>/showservice.cgi" target="<?php echo $link_target;?>">Graphs by Service</a></li>
<li><a href="<?php echo $cfg["cgi_base_url"];?>/showgroup.cgi" target="<?php echo $link_target;?>">Graphs by Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

  - If you keep the nagiosgraph cgi scripts in a location different than
    the nagios cgi scripts, then use 'ng_cgi_base_url' rather than
    'cgi_base_url' and make an entry in config.inc.php such as this:

$cfg['cgi_base_url']='/nagios/cgi-bin';
$cfg['ng_cgi_base_url']='/nagiosgraph/cgi-bin';



Customizing the Graphs
----------------------

The look and feel of nagiosgraph is controlled by the cascading style sheets
defined in nagiosgraph.css.  The examples directory contains a stylesheet file
with sample style sheets for fixing the controls to the page, floating the
controls above the graphs, or hiding the controls altogether.

Graphs can be customized individually by specifying CGI arguments, or they
can be customized overall by specifying values in the configuration files.

The following CGI arguments are recognized by show.cgi, showhost.cgi,
showservice.cgi, and showgroup.cgi:

 - hidengtitle
   Do not display the nagiosgraph title in the page.

 - geom=WxH
   Set the dimensions of all graphs to W pixels wide and H pixels tall.

 - showtitle
   Display a title next to each graph.

 - showdesc
   Display a description of data sources next to each graph.

 - showgraphtitle
   Display a title in each graph.

 - graphonly
   Display only graph data, not axes, grid, or legend.

 - hidelegend
   Do not display the legend in each graph.

 - fixedscale
   Set the Y-axis to be in the same scale as the performance data.  This
   is useful to prevent a variety of vertical scales when autoscaling
   results in different vertical scaling for each graph.

The following options are available via configuration files:

 - rrdopts
   Use the rrdopts option to specify custom RRD graphing options.  These
   can be specified for all graphs using rrdopts, or per-service using
   the rrdoptsfile.

 - lineformat
   Use lineformat to control the line thickness and line color for
   individual services.

 - plotas
 - plotasLINE1
 - plotasLINE2
 - plotasLINE3
 - plotasAREA
 - plotasTICK
   Use plotas to control the line thickness for individual services.

 - Create stacked area graphs using alpha channel in colors specified
   in the lineformat directive for each data source or in rrdopts.conf 
   for specific services and data sources.

 - Some services emit multiple data sources with big differences in magnitude.
   Others emit data with different units.  In such cases, split the data
   into seperate graphs by specifying one or more data sources.  For example,
   for the NTP service, jitter and offset are typically in the same range,
   while stratum is orders of magnitude larger.  So we specify two
   different graphs:

      show.cgi?host=HOST&service=NTP&db=ntp,jitter&db=ntp,offset
      show.cgi?host=HOST&service=NTP&db=ntp,stratum

   This assumes that jitter, offset, and stratum are all stored in a
   single RRD file using a map entry such as:

      /output:NTP.*Offset ([-.0-9]+).*jitter ([-.0-9]+).*stratum (\d+)/
      and push @s, [ 'ntp',
                     [ 'offset',  GAUGE, $1      ],
                     [ 'jitter',  GAUGE, $2/1000 ],
                     [ 'stratum', GAUGE, $3+1    ] ];

 - Data are identified by host, service, database, and data source.  It is
   possible to graph all sources from a single database, a single source
   from a database, selected sources from a single database, or selected
   sources from multiple databases.  In each case, the host and service
   must match.  For example:

      showgraph.cgi?host=HOST&service=SERVICE&db=loss
      showgraph.cgi?hsot=HOST&service=SERVICE&db=loss,losspct
      showgraph.cgi?host=HOST&service=SERVICE&db=ntp,jitter,offset
      showgraph.cgi?host=HOST&service=SERVICE&db=loss,losspct&db=rta,rta

   These options apply to showgraph.cgi, show.cgi, and showservice.cgi and
   in the configuration files hostdb.conf, groupdb.conf, and datasetdb.conf.

 - Use URLs as canned queries.  For example, define a 'temperatures'
   group in the groupdb.conf file that combines temperature data from
   multiple hosts and service types, then create a link to that group:

      http://server/cgi-bin/showgroup.cgi?group=temperatures

See the configuration files for more options and examples.



Adding Service Types
--------------------

Service types are added by creating rules in the 'map' file.  The map file
determines how data from Nagios will be stored.  Each rule determines how
output and performance data should be recorded.

The map file contains regular expressions to identify service types
and define content in RRD files. All entries are written in perl, so 
editing, adding or deleting entries requires some perl programming 
knowledge. Knowledge of RRD is also helpful.

There has to be one entry for each type of service. The map file included 
with nagiosgraph has several examples for cpu, memory, disk, network etc.
Most examples identify data from either Nagios output or Nagios perfdata
then define a number of RRD data sources.

insert.pl receives data from Nagios.  It formats data into a string consisting
of four lines of text.  This string might look like this:

  hostname:host0
  servicedesc:ping
  output:PING OK - Packet loss = 0%, RTA = 0.00 ms
  perfdata:

Or like this:

  hostname:host0
  servicedesc:CPU Load 
  output:OK - load average: 0.06, 0.12, 0.10
  perfdata:load1=0;15;30;0 load5=0;10;25;0 load15=0;5;20;0 

The official perfdata format is a space-delimited list of qualified
name-value pairs with this format:

  name=value[units];[warn];[crit];[min];[max]

where units is one of:
                  - unitless
          s,us,ms - time
                % - percentage
 B,KB,MB,GB,TB,PB - bytes
                c - counter

However, the perfdata is not always set, and the format of perfdata varies
a great deal from plugin to plugin.  So depending on type of service, the
most useful data can be in either the output or perfdata line.

For the ping example above, data can be extracted from the output line 
with a regular expression like this:

  /output:PING.*?(\d+)%.+?([.\d]+)\sms/

In this case, two values are extracted and available in $1 and $2. We can 
then create a data structure describing the content of the database. The 
general format is

  [ db-name,
    [ DS-name, TYPE, DS-value ],
    [ DS-name, TYPE, DS-value ],
    ...
  ]

Where DS name is the name that will be assigned to a line showing on RRD 
graphs. Each DS name must be no longer than 19 characters and must contain
only the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or underscore.  TYPE is either GAUGE or
DERIVE. the DS value is the data extracted in the regular expression. The
DS value can be an expression, for example to normalize to SI units.

Each database definition must be added to the @s array.

So the complete code to define and insert into an RRD file for the 
PING example above, becomes:

  /output:PING.*?(\d+)%.+?([.\d]+)\sms/
  and push @s, [ ping,
                [ losspct, GAUGE, $1      ],
                [ rta,     GAUGE, $2/1000 ] ];

In this case the database name is called 'ping' and the DS-names stored 
are losspct and rta. The Nagios output reports round trip time in 
milliseconds, so the value is divided by 1000 to convert to seconds. 
The type for each DS is GAUGE.

Be careful about the database names and DS names. In the code example 
above the names are barewords, which only works as long as the don't 
conflict with perl functions or subroutines. For example the word 'sleep' 
will not work without quoting.

A safer version of the above example is

  /output:PING.*?(\d+)%.+?([.\d]+)\sms/
  and push @s, [ 'ping',
                [ 'losspct', 'GAUGE', $1      ],
                [ 'rta',     'GAUGE', $2/1000 ] ];

After editing the map file, the syntax can be checked with

  perl -c map

Again a word of caution. If the map file has syntax errors, nothing will be 
inserted into RRD files until the file is fixed. So do not edit production 
map files. Instead do something like this:

  cp map map.edit
  vi map.edit
  perl -c map.edit
  mv map.edit map

Use testentry.pl to test a rule before putting it into production.  First run
the nagios check command from the command line to see what is returned.  Copy
this output and paste it into testentry.pl.  Paste the rule into testentry.pl.
Run testentry.pl to see how the output will be handled.

 - Changes to the map file generally do not require a restart of Nagios.

 - It may take awhile for data from a map entry to show up in an RRD file.
   This is partly due to the service check scheduling in Nagios, and partly
   due to the perfdata buffering of service_perfdata_file_processing_interval

 - Increase debug level in nagiosgraph.conf to see what is happening.
   The debug_insert parameter determines the log level for collecting data.
   Output will go to the nagiosgraph log file.  Keep an eye on the log file;
   it can grow big.  Perhaps rotate it, or decrease log level when everything
   works.

Share your work. If you have a good map file entry for standard Nagios 
plugins, then please post it on the forum.



Managing Data and RRD Files
---------------------------

nagiosgraph saves data in RRD files in the rrddir directory (specified in
nagiosgraph.conf).  By default, nagiosgraph uses a directory for each host,
and the RRD files are named based on the service description (from Nagios)
and the data names (from the map file).  For example, the default 
configuration for the PING service results in RRD files like this:

  /var/nagiosgraph/rrd/host/PING___pingloss.rrd
  /var/nagiosgraph/rrd/host/PING___pingrta.rrd

Older versions of nagiosgraph kept all RRD files in a single directory.
This is controlled by the dbseparator variable in nagiosgraph.conf.

Use the 'dump' and 'restore' options to rrdtool if you need to restructure
RRD files.  You might want to split data from a single RRD file into 
multiple files, or you might want to combine data from multiple RRD files
into a single file.  Or you might simply want to change the name of a 
data source.  The dump option will emit data in XML format:

  rrdtool dump service___db.rrd > service_db.xml

You can modify the XML with any text editor, then convert to RRD format:

  rrdtool restore service_db.xml service___db-new.rrd

Unfortunately the RRD file schema is not dynamic.  If an RRD file is created
with 2 data sources, more data sources cannot be added automatically.  For
example, you start recording UPS temperature to an RRD file using the
following map rule:

/perfdata:temperature=([.\d]+)/
and push @s, [ 'temp',
               [ 'temperature', GAUGE, $1 ] ];

Later you decide to include critical and warning temperatures using this
map rule:

/perfdata:temperature=([.\d]+);([.\d]+);([.\d]+)/
and push @s, [ 'temp',
               [ 'temperature', GAUGE, $1 ],
               [ 'warn',  GAUGE, $2 ],
               [ 'crit',  GAUGE, $3 ] ];

The new rule will still record temperature, but critical and warning values
will be discarded, because they are not defined in the RRD file.  You must do
a dump/edit/restore on the RRD file if you want to add critical/warning while
maintaining existing temperature data.  Alternatively you can simply delete
the existing RRD file and let the new map rule create the new RRD file.

What is the 'right' way to configure RRD files?  Should all data from a single
service go into a single RRD file?  Should each RRD file contain a single set
of data?  Some best practices have evolved over the past 10 years, but as of
this writing (febrary 2010) there is no single 'right' way.

Some people prefer to put all data from a single service into a single RRD
file, even if the data have different units.  For example, for the PING 
service their RRD files look something like this:

  PING___ping.rrd (losspct, losswarn, losscrit, rta, rtawarn, rtacrit)

Others prefer a separate file for each data source:

  PING___losspct.rrd (losspct)
  PING___losswarn.rrd (losswarn)
  PING___losscrit.rrd (losscrit)
  PING___rta.rrd (rta)
  PING___rtawarn.rrd (rtawarn)
  PING___rtacrit.rrd (rtacrit)

And others prefer something in between:

  PING___loss.rrd (losspct, losswarn, losscrit)
  PING___rta.rrd (rta, rtawarn, rtacrit)

It is a good idea to plan your configuration before you start recording data.
Although it is possible to reconfigure data after the RRD files are full,
doing so is somewhat tedious, especially for large numbers of hosts/services.

The 1.4.4 release of nagiosgraph added a generic map rule that matches any
standard performance data.  This rule puts the data into RRD files using this
structure:

  host0/service___label.rrd     (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])

For example, for service0 with 3 perfdata labels and service1 with 1 perfdata
labels, the rule generates the following RRD files:

  host0/service0___label0.rrd   (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])
  host0/service0___label1.rrd   (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])
  host0/service0___label2.rrd   (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])
  host0/service1___label0.rrd   (data[,warn][,crit][,min][,max])

There are a few rrdtool parameters that affect size of the RRD files and the
resolution of data:

  stepsize
  resolution
  heartbeat
  step

These parameters are used only when an RRD file is created.  By default they
are the same for all hosts and services, but they can be specified for
individual hosts, services, and or databases in the nagiosgraph configuration
file.  To modify these values for an existing RRD file you must do a
dump/edit/restore.  See the rrdtool documentation for details.



Configuring Access Controls
---------------------------

nagiosgraph does authorization (authz), not authentication (authn).  Access
is granted or denied to users for specific services and hosts.  There
are two ways to configure authorization: using nagios configuration files
or using a standalone nagiosgraph configuration file.

To use nagios access controls, define the following in nagiosgraph.conf:

  authzmethod=nagios3
  authzfile=/etc/nagios/cgi.cfg

nagiosgraph respects the following nagios variables:

  use_authentication
  default_user_name
  authorized_for_all_hosts
  authorized_for_all_services

To use nagiosgraph access controls, define the following in nagiosgraph.conf:

  authzmethod=nagiosgraph
  authzfile=/etc/nagiosgraph/access.conf

The nagiosgraph access control file uses the following syntax:

  host,service=user[,user[,...]]

Wildcards are permitted to match hosts, services, or users.  The exclamation
character negates permissions for a user.  For example:

  *=                  # deny access to everyone for all hosts and services
  *=*                 # grant access to everyone for all hosts and services
  host1=guest         # grant access to guest for all services on host1
  host1,ping=!guest   # deny access to guest for ping on host1
  *,ping=guest        # grant access to guest for ping on any host
  *.foo.com=guest     # grant access to guest for any host in foo.com

Permissions are respected by all nagiosgraph CGI scripts, so you can safely
distribute URLs for specific graphs or reports.



Troubleshooting
---------------

First identify whether your problem is with data collection or data display.

Are perfdata being collected by Nagios?  Run a nagios plugin directly and
make sure that it is working properly.  For example:

  check_ping -H host -w 100,10% -c 200,20%

Are permissions set correctly?  The nagios user must be able to write to
the rrd directory.  The nagios user must be able to write to the nagiosgraph
log file.  The web server user must be able to write to the nagiosgraph cgi
log file (which might be the same as the nagiosgraph log file for older
nagiosgraph installations).  If the web server user does not have permission
to modify the log file, nagiosgraph cgi logging will end up in the web server
error log.

Is nagiosgraph running?  In nagiosgraph.conf, set debug_insert=5 then look
at the nagiosgraph log file.  You should see messages from insert.pl.  Ensure
that insert.pl is being called as expected, either periodically by Nagios or
in a loop.

Are the RRD files being created?  The nagios user must have write permission
on the rrd directory.

Are the RRD files being modified?  Check the RRD file timestamp.

Are data being saved into RRD files?  With debug_insert=3, look in the
nagiosgraph log file for errors or warnings from insert.pl.  Problems with
map rules should be reported in the log file.  If necessary, increase the
log level to debug_insert=5.

Are the RRD file contents sane?  Use 'rrdtool dump filename.rrd'.  It is
normal for a new RRD file to be full of NaN.  As the file is updated those
should be replaced with proper values.  Ensure that the data source names in
the RRD file correspond to the names in the map rule.

Are there old or unused RRD files lying about?  Older versions of nagiosgraph
can be confused by multiple RRD files with the same data source for a single
host.  If you change the map rule for a service, you might want to move the
old RRD files out of the rrd directory.

If graphs are not being displayed, start by graphing a single host and service
with showgraph.cgi, for example showgraph.cgi?host=HOST&service=SERVICE.  Set
debug_showgraph=3 in nagiosgraph.conf, then look for output in the nagiosgraph
log file or the web server error log.

Be aware of what you are asking nagiosgraph to display.  Start with just a
host and service, then get more specific.  For example, each of these queries
will result in a different graph:
  show.cgi?host=HOST&service=PING
  show.cgi?host=HOST&service=PING&db=ping
  show.cgi?host=HOST&service=PING&db=ping,losspct,losswarn

To isolate problems in individual CGI scripts, use debug_show (show.cgi), 
debug_showhost (showhost.cgi), debug_showservice (showservice.cgi), or
debug_showgroup (showgroup.cgi) as appropriate.

For installations with many hosts and services, use the host/service
extensions when setting the log level (e.g. debug_showgraph_host = host)
to make the log information easier to grok.



Internationalization
--------------------

Translations are in a single file, with one file per language.  Strings for
both the cgi and javascript are in the same file.  The javascript translations
and language detection are controlled by the cgi scripts.

In order to minimize dependencies and overhead, nagiosgraph uses its own
system for internationalization.  It has a syntax similar to gettext.
Strings are defined in english within the perl and javascript code.  There
is no support for complex lexical structures - only string literals.  The
user interface to nagiosgraph is (so far) simple enough that this suffices.

To create a new translation, copy an existing translation file to a file
with the appropriate extension.  For example, nagiosgraph_es.conf is the
file for generic spanish.

Error messages are not translated.

Language is detected from the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE environment variable.  The
first language in this list is the language used.  If a language is specified
in the nagiosgraph configuration file, that language overrides anything in
the environment.

The language can be specified as an argument to each cgi script, for example:

  show.cgi?language=es

Language specified in this manner overrides any environment or configuration.

Platform Specific Notes
-----------------------

Nagios Embedded PERL (ePN)
--------------------------

The Nagios embedded PERL interpreter (ePN) does not understand every PERL
idiom.  In particular, it has problems with perldoc.  If you get errors
such as:

  ePN failed to compile /usr/lib/cgi-bin/nagios3/insert.pl: "Missing right
  curly or square bracket at (eval 1) line 45, at end of line syntax error
  at (eval 1) line 52, at EOF" at /usr/lib/nagios3/p1.pl line 250

then you must explicitly invoke PERL for insert.pl.  For example,
for batch processing use this:

     command_line /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/nagios/libexec/insert.pl

or for immediate processing use this:

     command_line /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/nagios/libexec/insert.pl "$LASTSERVICECHECK$||$HOSTNAME$||$SERVICEDESC$||$SERVICEOUTPUT$||$SERVICEPERFDATA$"



CentOS 5 and Nagiosgraph 0.9:
-----------------------------

  wget 'http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rrdtool/rrdtool-1.2.18-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm'
  wget 'http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rrdtool/perl-rrdtool-1.2.18-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm'
  wget 'http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rrdtool/rrdtool-devel-1.2.18-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm'
  wget 'http://mesh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagiosgraph/nagiosgraph-0.9.0.tgz'
  yum install -y libart_lgpl.i386
  rpm -hiv *rrdtool*.rpm

  tar xzvf nagiosgraph-0.9.0.tgz
  cd nagiosgraph-0.9.0
  mkdir /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph
  cp -r . /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph/
  mkdir /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph/rrd
  chmod go+rX /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph
  chown nagios /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph/rrd
  mkdir -p /var/spool/nagios
  touch /var/log/nagiosgraph.log /var/spool/nagios/perfdata.log

  ln -s /usr/local/nagios/nagiosgraph/nagiosgraph.conf /usr/local/etc/nagiosgraph.conf

  cp nagiosgraph.css /usr/local/nagios/share/stylesheets



MacOSX 10.5 and Nagios 2.12
---------------------------

Use the lib/insert.sh wrapper to ensure that perl is invoked properly.

  define command {
      command_name    process-service-perfdata
      command_line    /usr/local/nagios/libexec/insert.sh "$LASTSERVICECHECK$||$HOSTNAME$||$SERVICEDESC$||$SERVICEOUTPUT$||$SERVICEPERFDATA$"
  }



Fedora Core 6 and HTTP output parsing
-------------------------------------

The entry in the map file for HTTP does not work for Fedora core 6
with Nagios 2.6 and later.  This is what did work.

	# Service type: unix-www
	#   ouput:OK - HTTP/1.1 302 Found - 0.002 second response time |time=0.001920s;;;0.000000 size=126B;;;0
	/output:.*?HTTP.*?([.0-9]+) sec/
	and push @s, [ http,
		[ rt, GAUGE, $1 ] ];



Notes For Developers
--------------------

The makefile rules control pretty much everything.  To create the makefile,

  perl Makefile.PL

Basic targets are the same as any MakeMaker perl module.

  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean
  make realclean

There are rules to build a source distribution, debian, and redhat packages.

  make dist                  creates nagiosgraph-x.y.z.tar.gz
  make deb-package           creates nagsiograph-x.y.z.deb
  make rpm-package           creates nagiosgraph-x.y.z.rpm

If you would like to contribute to nagiosgraph, there are a few things you
should do to make your life and the lives of the other nagiosgraph developers
easier.

- please respect these design goals:
   - do not break existing installations
   - minimize dependencies
   - keep it simple

- perlcritic

  Run perlcritic and fix all warnings before you commit.  Be brutal:

      perlcritic -1 cgi/*.cgi
      perlcritic -1 etc/*.pm

  or use the make rule to run them all:

      make critic

- unit tests

  Run the unit tests before modifying existing functionality.  Write unit
  tests before you add code.

      make test

- test coverage

  To generate code coverage reports, install Devel::Cover then run tests:

      make test-coverage

  This will generate a cover_db directory with code coverage metrics.

- profiling

  Use the perl profiler to see which parts of the code are taking most time.
  Run the cgi script with DProf enabled, specifying args on the command line.

      perl -d:DProf cgi/show.cgi
      perl -d:DProf cgi/showgraph.cgi host=HOST service=SERVICE

  Then view the profiling results.

      dprofpp

  The bottlenecks are RRDs::graph (showgraph.cgi) and RRDs::info (show.cgi).
  RRDs::info is invoked on each file in the rrd directory tree.  On a 1.4GHz
  G4 PPC, getting info on 500 files takes about 0.2 seconds.

- internationalization (i18n)

  To get a list of all translated string constants, do the following:

      grep '_(' cgi/*.cgi etc/*.pm | sed -e 's/.*_(\([^)]*\).*/\1/' | sort -u
      grep '_(' share/*.js | sed -e 's/.*_(\([^)]*\).*/\1/' | sort -u

  nagiosgraph uses a bare bones, home-grown, standalone implementation of
  i18n.  If you add strings to the user interface or error handling, please
  follow the pattern used for other strings in the code.  All translations
  reside in a single file, with one file per language.  Each file is used
  by the cgi (directly) and the javascript (via the cgi).

- configurations

  Be consistent in configuration files and documentation about where the
  nagiosgraph files are installed, regardless of what you use.  Use the
  overlay layout, with nagios installed at /usr/local/nagios

- perldoc

  You can preview the perldoc by doing the following:

    perldoc install.pl
    perldoc cgi/show.cgi
    perldoc etc/ngshared.pm
