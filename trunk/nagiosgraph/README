Nagiosgraph is an add-on of Nagios. It collects service performance data into
rrd format, and displays the resulting graphs via cgi.  It can be embedded
directly into Nagios so that graphs show up just like other trend reports.

The INSTALL file contains installation and configuration instructions.

Principles of Operations
------------------------

nagiosgraph is a simple interface between Nagios and rrd data files.

nagiosgraph operates in two modes. One is to collect performance data
from Nagios servicechecks, and the other is to display graphs of
the performance data collected.

All the data collected are stored in rrd files using rrdtool. A file
called 'map' defines how to identify the data from nagios and how to
store them in the rrd files. Nagios passes all the service data to a
nagiosgraph script called 'insert.pl'. This script uses the file 'map'
to determine how to name the data and into which rrd files to insert
the data. The map file also processes the data, for example by changing
units or applying scaling factors.

The 'map' configuration file is actually perl code, that is eval'ed
by 'insert.pl'. Several examples of servicechecks are included in
the distributed 'map' file, but generally it is necessary to make
modifications or add entries to match the output of the particular
nagios plugins in use. Knowing perl regular expression is helpful,
but the examples supplied should cover most types of performance data.

For graphing, nagiosgraph includes cgi scripts. 'show.cgi' looks up
performance data for a single host and service, and generates line
charts accordingly.  Other scripts display all hosts for a specific
service, all services for a specific host, or arbitrary groups of hosts
and services.  These run out-of-the-box with minimal configuration, or
they can be customized, using a configuration file or interactively.

Graphs can be integrated into Nagios using Nagios' extended information
for services and hosts.  By specifying nagiosgraph cgi scripts in the
Nagios configuration, individual graphs and collections of graphs can be
linked directly to hosts and services in Nagios web pages.

By default, all available data for a servicecheck will be displayed in
the same graph. With extra configuration, either embedded in the url, 
specified in a configuration file, or using controls in a web page, it is
possible to display less data or to split values into multiple graphs.
There is also a general method for specifying arbitrary rrd graph
options such as line style, color, and scaling for individual hosts or
services.
