Nagiosgraph is an add-on of Nagios. It collects service performance data into
rrd format, and displays the resulting graphs via cgi.  It can be embedded
directly into Nagios so that graphs show up just like other trend reports.

Principles of Operations
------------------------

nagiosgraph is basically a simple interface between Nagios and rrd data
files. Simplicity comes from three factors; it doesn't do much, behavior
is programmed rather than configurable, and automatically detects new
data from Nagios.

nagiosgraphs is operating in two modes. One is to collect performance
data from servicechecks from nagios, and the other is to display graphs
of the performance data collected.

All the data collected are stored in rrd files by using rrdtools. A file
called 'map' defines how identify the data from nagios and how to store
it in the rrd files. Nagios passes all the service data collected to a
nagiosgraph script called 'insert.pl'. This script will look up in
'map', which rrd file to insert the data into, and how to name the data.

In Nagios, it's possible to have extended service information pages.
A nagiosgraph cgi script called 'show.cgi' is used for such service
information links. 'show.cgi' looks up performance data stored in rrd file
directories, and generates line charts accordingly.

nagiosgraph automatically detects new hosts or services added in Nagios,
so generally no re-configuration of nagiosgraph is necessary.

The 'map' configuration file is actually perl code, that will be eval'ed
by 'insert.pl' and 'show.cgi'. Several examples of servicechecks are
included in the distributed 'map' file, but generally it's necessary to
make modifications or add entries to match the output of the particular
nagios plugins in use. Knowing perl regular expression is helpful,
but the examples supplied should cover most types of performance data.

By default all available data for a servicecheck will be displayed in
the same graph. With extra configuration, embedded in the url, it's
possible to display less data or to split values into multiple graphs.
There is also a general method for specifying any rrd graph options.
