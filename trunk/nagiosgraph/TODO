Desired features.

* Custom reports - combine graphs of various types on one page.
  - This is partially addressed by showhost.cgi (all graphs for one host on a
    page) and showservice.cgi (all graphs for one service on a page).
* Customize rrd options for split graphs.
* User defined colors.
* Red bar in graph to indicate missing data.
* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.0).
* Stacked area graphs like http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/gallery/ramUsage.png.
  - This requires configuring a custom graph type for a specific data set,
    since other data sets may not work well with an area graph type.
