Bugs

* so much for simplicity - javascript is now required
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'
* gui controls do not prevent specifying future end date.
* nagios-based authorization does not yet respect contacts

Desired features.

* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Use cookies to maintain GUI state - CGI args work but have too many corner
    cases that cause problems (e.g. stickiness of next/prev URLs)
* re-do the default map rules to match the plugins shipped in standard, current
    nagios configurations for mainstream distros
* do pattern matching in the groupdb and hostdb files
* data labels should be applied to graphs, not just html
* do test coverage on the cgi scripts, not just ngshared.pm
* make authz understand groups, not just users
* make offset accept abbreviations (e.g. 1w, 2d, 3m)
