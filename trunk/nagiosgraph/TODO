Bugs

* so much for simplicity - javascript is now required
* layouts should degrade more gracefully when no CSS
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'
* gui controls do not prevent specifying future end date.

Desired features.

* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Use cookies to maintain GUI state - CGI args work but have too many corner
    cases that cause problems (e.g. stickiness of next/prev URLs)
* re-do the default map rules to match the plugins shipped in standard, current
    nagios configurations for mainstream distros
* do authorization using a single access file
* remove fixedscale from the gui
* change definition of fixedscale to have pattern of other rrdopts
