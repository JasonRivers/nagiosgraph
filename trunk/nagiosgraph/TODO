Bugs

* so much for simplicity - javascript is required for show.cgi,
    showhost.cgi, showservice.cgi, showgroup.cgi (but not showgraph.cgi)
* layouts could degrade more gracefully when no CSS
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'
* per-db labels are not implemented
* gui controls do not prevent specifying future end date.

Desired features.

* Customize rrd options for split graphs.
* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Use cookies to maintain GUI state - CGI args work but have too many corner
    cases that cause problems (e.g. stickiness of next/prev URLs)
* Internationalization of all string constants
* Separate config file for service, data, and axis labels
