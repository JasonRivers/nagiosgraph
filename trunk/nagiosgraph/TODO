Bugs

* The next/prev functions are not coordinated with the data saved to the rrd
    files.  As a result, next/prev do not function as one might expect.
* showhost and showgroup do not need all the menudata in javascript
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'
* need unit tests for rrdline, graphinfo

Desired features.

* Customize rrd options for split graphs.
* Red bar in graph to indicate missing data.
* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Stacked area graphs like http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/gallery/ramUsage.png.
  - This requires configuring a custom graph type for a specific data set,
    since other data sets may not work well with an area graph type.
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Units specification beyond what Fixed Scale does.
* Prefix strings with i18n_ to avoid name clashes with configuration params.
* Either use cookies to maintain GUI state, or design a more robust and
    easier-to-manage CGI/JavaScript way of doing it.
