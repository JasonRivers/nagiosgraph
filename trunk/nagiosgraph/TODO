Bugs

* The next/prev functions are not coordinated with the data saved to the rrd
    files.  As a result, next/prev do not function as one might expect.
* showhost and showgroup do not need all the menudata in javascript
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'

Desired features.

* Customize rrd options for split graphs.
* Red bar in graph to indicate missing data.
* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Prefix strings with i18n_ to avoid name clashes with configuration params.
* Either use cookies to maintain GUI state, or design a more robust and
    easier-to-manage CGI/JavaScript way of doing it.
