Bugs

* so much for simplicity - javascript is now required
* layouts should degrade more gracefully when no CSS
* the subroutine 'debug' should be called 'log'
* gui controls do not prevent specifying future end date.
* showgraph.cgi does not respect permissions

Desired features.

* Installer - that can configure Nagios (must work with Nagios 2.12 and 3.x).
* Custom unit labels on the graphs.
* Use cookies to maintain GUI state - CGI args work but have too many corner
    cases that cause problems (e.g. stickiness of next/prev URLs)
* re-do the default map rules to match the plugins shipped in standard, current
    nagios configurations for mainstream distros
* do authorization using a single text file instead of perl code
* remove fixedscale from the gui
* change definition of fixedscale to have pattern of other rrdopts
* do pattern matching in the groupdb and hostdb files
* data labels should be applied to graphs, not just html
* do test coverage on the cgi scripts, not just ngshared.pm
* add stepsize parameter when creating rrd files
* write unit tests to ensure old cgi format of db=db[,ds[,ds[,ds[...]]]]
   for show.cgi, showservice.cgi, showgraph.cgi
* write unit tests to ensure old cgi format of db=db[,ds[,ds[,ds[...]]]]
   for hostdb.conf, groupdb.conf, datasetdb.conf
