=head1 NAME

show.cgi - Graph Nagios data for a specific service on a specific host

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a CGI script that is designed to be run on a web server.  It generates
a page of HTML that displays a list of graphs for a single service on a single
host.  The graph data are retrieved from RRD files.

The showgraph.cgi script generates the graphs themselves.

=head1 USAGE

B<show.cgi>?host=host_name&service=service_name

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item host=host_name

=item service=service_description

=item db=database[,ds-name[,ds-name[,ds-name[...]]]]

=item period=(day week month quarter year)

=item geom=WIDTHxHEIGHT

=item rrdopts=<rrdgraph options>

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Use the debug_show setting from B<nagiosgraph.conf> to control the amount
of debug information that will be emitted by this script.  Debug output will
go to the nagiosgraph log or web server error log.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The B<nagiosgraph.conf> file controls the behavior of this script.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over 4

=item B<ngshared.pm>

This is the nagiosgraph perl library.  It contains code used by this script.

=item B<showgraph.cgi>

This generates the graphs that are embedded in the HTML.

=item B<rrdtool>

This provides the data storage and graphing system.

=item B<RRDs>

This provides the perl interface to rrdtool.

=item B<Nagios>

Although this CGI script can be used with RRD files independent of Nagios, it
is designed to be used with Nagios.

=back

=head1 INSTALLATION

Copy B<ngshared.pm> and B<nagiosgraph.conf> to a configuration directory
such as /etc/nagiosgraph.

Copy this file to a CGI script directory on a web server and ensure that
it is executable by the web server.  Modify the B<use lib> line to point
to the configuration directory.

Edit B<nagiosgraph.conf> as needed.

Alan Brenner, moved subroutines into a shared file (ngshared.pm), added color
number nine, and added support for showhost.cgi and showservice.cgi.
