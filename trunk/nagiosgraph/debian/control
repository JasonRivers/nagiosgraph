Description: Nagios add-on for performance data storage and graphing
 NagiosGraph is an add-on to Nagios.  Nagios monitors one or more services on
 each host.  NagiosGraph extracts information from the Nagios output, processes
 it, then inserts it into one or more round-robin database (RRD) files.  CGI
 scripts display data from the RRD files as web pages.  The CGI output can be
 embedded directly into Nagios so that graphs show up like other trend reports.
